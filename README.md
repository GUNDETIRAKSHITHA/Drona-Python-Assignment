# Drona-Python-Assignment
# Q1-Simulated Drone Movement System

This Python program uses the Turtle module to simulate the movement of a drone. The drone can move in four directions: forward, backward, left, and right.

## Setup
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the Turtle module by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install PythonTurtle
# Usage
Clone the repository or download the Python script (Q1.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the script is located.
Run the script using the following command:
python Q1.py
The Turtle graphics window will appear, displaying a blue drone with a yellow propeller.
Control the drone using the arrow keys on your keyboard:
Up Arrow: Move the drone forward
Down Arrow: Move the drone backward
Left Arrow: Turn the drone to the left
Right Arrow: Turn the drone to the right
Example
The program includes example usage of movement functions, moving the drone forward, turning right, moving backward, and turning left.

Notes
Close the Turtle graphics window to exit the program.
Feel free to modify the code to customize the appearance or behavior of the drone.
